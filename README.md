# PhpStorm_Live_Templates_xml
I have looked high and low for Genesis snippets for PhpStorm without much luck.  Therefore I have decided to create my own.
This is my repo of Genesis Live Templates for Genesis.

## Installation Instructions
1. Download and unzip this file.
2. Copy the genesis.xml file and paste into \config\templates file in your PphStorm directory.
3. You may need to restart PhpStorm for the snippets to work.

## Usage
All you have to do is type what you want and auto-complete will show you the suggestions.  Each Live Template has a prefix set to it and you will need to use that prefix to ensure auto-complete gets the right snippet.

## Support
These snippets are provided as is - without any support.
